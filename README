Puppet module to manage login records.

E.g. disable successful and failed login records.

All functionality is currently only available on Debian GNU/Linux.
Bits should be made available for other operating systems after
checking they are configured the same way.

Defaults to disable all supported login records.

Dependencies
============

- the common module: git://labs.riseup.net/shared-common

Configuration
=============

You can set the following parameters for the loginrecords class.
If you just include the class loginrecords this will disable all
loginlogs.

$disable_btmp, $disable_wtmp
---------------------------

Default: /var/log/btmp and /var/log/wtmp are ensured to be absent.

These variables, when set to a false, non-empty value, have these
files created and their logging enabled again.

$disable_utmp
-------------

Default: /var/run/utmp is not removed.

WARNING: Removing utmp removes necessary information for binaries such
as runlevel. This might break other scripts that are relaying on the
output of this binary or other scripts depending on their output. For
example it is known that puppet will not anymore be able to idempodently
manage runlevels. -> https://projects.puppetlabs.com/issues/5409

$disable_faillog
----------------

Default: faillog is disabled.
When set to false, faillog is enabled.

$disable_lastlog
----------------

Default: lastlog is disabled.
When set to a false, non-empty value, lastlog is not changed.
